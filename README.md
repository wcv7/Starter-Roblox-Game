This Is A Mini Roblox Game I Made While Bored You Can Change It However You Want I Believe Its Quite Easy To Read All You Need To Do Is To Create A Folder In ReplicatedStorage Called {RemoteEvents} and 2 Remote Events Inside That Called {GiveCash, PowerUP}, And Then Create The Scripts And Copy The Code Over To The Correct Scripts, May Update Autoclicker With A GamePass Feature But If You Want To Add The Feature Now You Can Use This <a href="https://github.com/wcv7/Roblox-GamePass-Door">Repository</a>.

This Is A VERY Outdated Version Of The Game I Am Currently Working On
